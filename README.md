# Line Mapping Tool – COMP 3110

This project contains a Java program that compares two versions of a source file and identifies how individual lines have changed. The tool reports which lines stayed the same, which ones moved, and which were inserted or deleted. It was developed based on the requirements provided in class and tested on both the original Eclipse dataset and new test pairs that I added for the group portion of the assignment.

## Project Files

* `src/` – main source code, including the line mapping tool and the evaluator
* `eclipseTest/` – the full test set provided by the instructor
* `tests/` – my custom test pairs and XML mapping files
* `custom_outputs/` – output mappings generated by the tool
* `run_all_tests.sh` – script to run the instructor’s dataset
* `run_group_25_pairs.sh` – script to run the custom test set

## How It Works (Brief Overview)

The program first normalizes and tokenizes the lines of each file. It uses an LCS-based approach to find stable “anchors” and then compares the remaining lines using token similarity and local search to avoid mismatches. When anchors or similarities are strong enough, the line is mapped; otherwise it is marked as inserted or deleted. The tool prints the final mapping as:

```
oldLine   newLine
```

## Running the Program

Compile the code:

```
javac src/*.java
```

Run the instructor dataset:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

Run the custom dataset:

```
./run_custom_tests.sh
```

Or run the tool manually:

```
java LineMappingTool old.java new.java
```
